# KCSA Labs: Kubernetes & Cloud Native Security

This repository contains hands-on labs for **Kubernetes and cloud native security** performed on the **Al Nafi cloud lab environment.**
It focuses on securing containers, workloads, networks, and Kubernetes clusters using practical security controls.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- Practice Kubernetes security concepts in real lab scenarios
- Apply security policies, RBAC, and admission controls
- Secure container images and supply chains
- Implement network policies and pod security standards
- Document security experiments and findings where applicable

This portfolio reflects hands-on security labs rather than full theoretical documentation.

## 🧪 Lab Environment

- Platform: Al Nafi lab cloud machines
- Tools: Kubernetes, Docker, Bash
- Execution: Remote cloud lab nodes
- Focus: Practical security implementations

## ▶️ How to Use
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/muhammadhammad2005/KCSA.git
cd KCSA
```
Explore each folder to apply YAML manifests or run scripts related to security testing, policy enforcement, and compliance checks.

## 🔄 Continuous Updates

This repository is actively maintained.
More security labs, attack simulations, and compliance scenarios will be added over time.

## 📘 Notes

- Labs are executed in the Al Nafi cloud lab environment, not local machines
- Some folders contain only YAML or scripts without Markdown documentation
- This portfolio demonstrates real-world Kubernetes security and DevSecOps practices
